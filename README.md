# Advent-Of-Code

My solutions in C++ for Advent of Code 2023! No extra self-made utility functions are used in the solutions and each puzzle input is read from a text file. Make sure you're in the correct directory before compiling.

### Compilation

Using `clang++`
```
clang++ -std=c++11 -o dayX_part1 dayX_part1.cpp
```

Using `g++`
```
g++ -std=c++11 -o dayX_part1 dayX_part1.cpp
```
Replace X with the day and part1 with part2 for the part2 solution.

### Running

run the program using:
```
./dayX_part1
```
The answer should be printed in the console:

Enjoy!
